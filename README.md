Favour Composition over Inheritance in Java
	- In Java multiple inheritance is not possible so inheritance is not that much favourable than composition
	- Flexible to replace in Composition
	- In Inhertitance when super class is changed, the sub class becomes fragile

High cohesion is when you have a class that does a well defined job. Low cohesion is when a class does a lot of jobs that don't have much in common.
